        <h1>Welcome to Oxford VR Solutions!</h1>

        <img src="vrStats.png" width="40%" id="statistics">
        <p class="flow-text">The virtual reality industry was valued at $25.21 billion in 2022 and is predicted to continue to grow in the coming years. Out of this, the VR hardware industry made $7.62 billion, the software industry $2.37 billion, and VR advertising made $151.23 million. All of these numbers are predicted to grow over the next 5 years. </p>

        <p class="flow-text"> Companies have begun using VR in a variety of ways. One example can be seen in the oil companies BP and ExxonMobil, who both use VR to prepare the workers for the workplace. By using VR to simulate common workplace scenarios such as starting the machines and emergency protocols, this will reduce the likelihood of accidents occuring in the real world. Zimmer Biomet uses VR to show its customers the results of various surgical and dental routines, helping their customers make the best choices. This means that there is also a growth in the number of people needed to develop these simulations, contributing to the massive growth in the VR industry.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">Established companies such as Facebook (now known as Meta), Apple, and Microsoft have all begun to invest large amounts of money into VR and AR technologies, and companies such as Magic Leap and Niantic formed to take advantage of this growing industry. Companies such as Matterport will take scans of buildings, which people can then tour virtually from the comfort of their home. Companies have also begun exploring using VR to hold virtual meetings, as opposed to meeting in person or through other digital platforms such as Zoom.</p>

        <img src="vrTraining.jpg" width="40%" id="training">
        <p class="flow-text">VR has even begun being used by the military and law enforcement as a tool for training, rather than spending money on real props and actors for training exercises.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <p class="flow-text">See the below video to see how Hilton uses VR as a tool to prepare their workforce for the work environment.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">Here are some more examples of companies using VR to expand their brand:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="flow-text">GSK, a British pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, made a virtual reality simulator called the Exedrin Migraine Experience, allowing users to experience the visual symptoms of migraines. This helps the company educate the public about migraines and build empathy for those who suffer from them.</li>
            <li class="flow-text">As a way of promoting their TERREX line of outdoor gear, Adidas released Delicatessen, a rock climbing simulator that serves to promote their line while also educating players about how to get into rock climbing and doing it safely.</li>
            <li class="flow-text">Thomas Cook, a UK travel agency, created a series of VR experiences through their Try Before You Fly campaign, allowing users to experience virtual vacation experiences, such as visiting the pyramids in Egypt. This campaign resulted in more people going to the company to plan their vacations.</li>
            <li class="flow-text">Volvo used VR as a way to allow potential customers to experience what it is like driving their new XC90, and allowed users to fully tour the interior of the vehicle as well. Through this campaign, Volvo gained an increased number of people asking for more information about their vehicles.</li>
            <li class="flow-text">Lowe’s uses VR on both the corporate and customer ends of the business. Lowe’s has developed the Holoroom, allowing customers to learn various DIY skills, such as tiling a shower, giving them the confidence and ability to apply these skills to their own projects. Lowe’s also uses the Holoroom as a way to teach their employees how to use the various tools around the store, improving their ability to help customers.</li>
            <li class="flow-text">Topshop, in a partnership with Inition UK, brought a fashion show during London Fashion Week to any who bought a ticket through VR, allowing a wider audience to experience a usually difficult-to-attend event.</li>
